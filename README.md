# DES-Implementation
This code uses the pyDes library to implement the DES encryption algorithm. The des_encrypt function takes the encryption key and message as input and returns the encrypted message. The des_decrypt function takes the encryption key and encrypted message as input and returns the decrypted message.

### Note: 
DES encryption is considered to be relatively weak and has been largely replaced by stronger encryption algorithms such as AES. This code is for educational purposes only and should not be used for actual security purposes.
